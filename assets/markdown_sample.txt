# Markdown NEW FROM FILE!  
Markdown allows you to easily include formatted text, images, and even formatted Dart code in your app.

## Styling
Style text as _italic_, __bold__, or `inline code`.

- Use bulleted lists
- To better clarify
- Your points

## Links
You can use [hyperlinks](hyperlink) in markdown

## Images

You can include images:

## Markdown widget

This is an example of how to create your own Markdown widget:

    new Markdown(data: 'Hello _world_!');

## Code blocks
Formatted Dart code looks really pretty too:

```
void main() {
  runApp(new MaterialApp(
    home: new Scaffold(
      body: new Markdown(data: markdownData)
    )
  ));
}
```

Enjoy!
